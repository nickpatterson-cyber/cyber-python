"""
This script will execute shell command lsof -i -n -P | grep LISTEN | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9 using os.system().
This command will list all the processes that are listening on a network port on the system and then kills them using the kill -9 command.

It is worth noting that this script will kill all the processes that are listening on a port, regardless of whether they are important system processes or not.
It is also worth noting that using kill -9 will forcefully close the processes, which may cause data loss or corruption.

It is highly recommended to use this script with caution. It is also recommended to check the processes that are listening on a port before closing them, and close only those that are not essential for the system to function properly.
