# here is a very simple python script which will check a LINUX operating system for
# signs of ransomware. It is by no means a ground breaking solution.
# it will look for common extensions used by ransomware, including ".crypt" and ".enc", 
# as well as files that contain certain ransom note names, such as "_HELP_instructions" which can be common with BadRabbit variants in the past.
